# Gym Mobile

This Android project involves a mobile application designed to help users perform workout routines 
at the gym. The application offers an intuitive interface with predefined routines and selection 
buttons to start each exercise. The primary goal of this project was to practice and implement the 
following Android components:

Services: To manage background tasks related to the execution of exercises (for example, tracking time,
notifications, etc.).
Broadcasts: To communicate important events within the application or with other system components 
(for example, receiving notifications of exercise completion, changes in system status, etc.).
